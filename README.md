# Full Stack Trivia API Project

This project is a demonstration of how to develop and use API and API documentation with the main goal to build a trivia API. Trivia is an game app that allows to:

1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

By completing this trivia app, various abilities such as to structure plan, implement, and test an API are demonstrated - skills essential for enabling any future applications to communicate with others.
